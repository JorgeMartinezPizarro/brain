# Beyond Rational Artificial Intelligence Network (BRAIN)
### Bridging humanity and technology with efficiency and purpose

## Abstract
Beyond Rational Artificial Intelligence Network (BRAIN) aims to create a sustainable and efficient integration between human creativity and technology. It fosters evolutionary efficiency, supported by AI, while prioritizing meaningful connections and solving real-world challenges. Without meaning, purpose is lost, and inefficiency prevails.

## Description
In a world full of cutting-edge technologies and constant innovation, BRAIN bridges the gap between STEAM education and practical technology applications. It leverages powerful tools and methodologies to create a sustainable balance between human creativity and technological progress. 

### Key Goals:
- Foster meaningful integration between devices and cloud services.
- Develop a **Planetary File System**, inspired by Tim Berners-Lee's SOLID and interconnection ideas.
- Utilize cutting-edge technologies to promote financial inclusion, efficiency, and collaboration.

### Core Technologies:
- **LND**: Local payment systems integration.
- **BTC**: Global payment network connections.
- **LLM**: Language Models for personal and contextual training.
- **SQL**: Structured data management.
- **RDF**: Semantic connections for knowledge representation.
- **ADN**: Human evolution metaphor and interconnection.

## Folder Structure
- **docker-compose/**: Modular services managed with Docker.
  - **lnd**: Local payment networks connecting to the global Lightning Network. [TODO]
  - **matrix**: Human networking and communication (Signal and bridges).
  - **nextcloud**: Profile management and file synchronization.
  - **wordpress**: Content sharing and experiences.
  - **nextjs**: Frontend with three main tabs:
    - **Monitoring**: Displays system stats. [DONE]
    - **Payment**: Manages LND connections. [TODO]
    - **Training**: Personal training using LLMs. [DONE]
- **volumes/**: Persistent system data stored in an external Docker registry.
- **Makefile**: System commands for managing the BRAIN environment.
- **default/**: System configuration synced with nginx in the host.
- **.env**: Default system values (passwords, users, etc.).

## Usage
### Basic Commands:
- `make start`: Start the BRAIN system for individual or organizational use.
- `make stop`: Shut down the BRAIN system containers.
- `make save`: Save the current BRAIN snapshot as a Docker tag.
- `make load`: Restore the BRAIN system from a saved Docker tag.

By installing tools like Nextcloud and Signal on your devices, you can:
- Synchronize files seamlessly for personal or institutional use.
- Communicate across networks like school, family, or work.

### Advanced Setup:

To start the services it is recommended to setup nginx or apache2 as follows:

```
## nextcloud login as a login umbrella for the nextjs container

# dev cloud
server {
        server_name your.cloud.domain;
        client_max_body_size 20G;
        client_body_buffer_size 400M;
        location ^~ /.well-known {
                # The rules in this block are an adaptation of the rules
                # in `.htaccess` that concern `/.well-known`.

                location = /.well-known/carddav { return 301 /remote.php/dav/; }
                location = /.well-known/caldav  { return 301 /remote.php/dav/; }

                location /.well-known/acme-challenge    { try_files $uri $uri/ =404; }
                location /.well-known/pki-validation    { try_files $uri $uri/ =404; }

                # Let Nextcloud's API for `/.well-known` URIs handle all other
                # requests by passing them to the front-end controller.
                return 301 /index.php$request_uri;
        }

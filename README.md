# Beyond Rational Artificial Intelligence Network (BRAIN)
### Bridging humanity and technology with efficiency and purpose

## Abstract
Beyond Rational Artificial Intelligence Network (BRAIN) aims to create a sustainable and efficient integration between human creativity and technology. It fosters evolutionary efficiency, supported by AI, while prioritizing meaningful connections and solving real-world challenges. Without meaning, purpose is lost, and inefficiency prevails.

## Description
In a world full of cutting-edge technologies and constant innovation, BRAIN bridges the gap between STEAM education and practical technology applications. It leverages powerful tools and methodologies to create a sustainable balance between human creativity and technological progress. 

### Key Goals:
- Foster meaningful integration between devices and cloud services.
- Develop a **Planetary File System**, inspired by Tim Berners-Lee's SOLID and interconnection ideas.
- Utilize cutting-edge technologies to promote financial inclusion, efficiency, and collaboration.

### Core Technologies:
- **LND**: Local payment systems integration.
- **BTC**: Global payment network connections.
- **LLM**: Language Models for personal and contextual training.
- **SQL**: Structured data management.
- **RDF**: Semantic connections for knowledge representation.
- **ADN**: Human evolution metaphor and interconnection.

## Folder Structure
- **docker-compose/**: Modular services managed with Docker.
  - **lnd**: Local payment networks connecting to the global Lightning Network. [TODO]
  - **matrix**: Human networking and communication (Signal and bridges).
  - **nextcloud**: Profile management and file synchronization.
  - **wordpress**: Content sharing and experiences.
  - **nextjs**: Frontend with three main tabs:
    - **Monitoring**: Displays system stats. [DONE]
    - **Payment**: Manages LND connections. [TODO]
    - **Training**: Personal training using LLMs. [DONE]
- **volumes/**: Persistent system data stored in an external Docker registry.
- **Makefile**: System commands for managing the BRAIN environment.
- **default/**: System configuration synced with nginx in the host.
- **.env**: Default system values (passwords, users, etc.).

## Usage
### Basic Commands:
- `make start`: Start the BRAIN system for individual or organizational use.
- `make stop`: Shut down the BRAIN system containers.
- `make save`: Save the current BRAIN snapshot as a Docker tag.
- `make load`: Restore the BRAIN system from a saved Docker tag.

By installing tools like Nextcloud and Signal on your devices, you can:
- Synchronize files seamlessly for personal or institutional use.
- Communicate across networks like school, family, or work.

## Civil Institutions
For institutions, BRAIN offers:
- **Financial Inclusion**: Enable lightweight payments with Lightning Network.
- **Efficiency**: Use affordable devices, like smartphones, for seamless integration.
- **Accessibility**: Promote inclusion without the need for expensive infrastructure.

## Use Cases
BRAIN adapts to real-world scenarios through practical applications. From simplifying daily tasks to empowering education and fostering financial inclusion, explore how BRAIN can make a difference.

- **[Paythering](INFO.md#paythering):** Revolutionizing daily transactions with efficient payment networks.
- **[Education and Politics: IA-Supported](INFO.md#education-and-politics-ia---supported-not-driven):** Enabling seamless learning and collaboration through technology.

For detailed examples, see the [Use Cases document](INFO.md).

## Get Involved
We believe in collaboration and shared purpose. Whether you're a programmer, educator, or philosopher, there's a place for you in BRAIN.

### How to Contribute:
1. Explore the repository and familiarize yourself with its structure.
2. Join discussions on community-driven platforms.
3. Share ideas and propose solutions to bridge humanity and technology.

### Open Issues:
- Discuss the use of Signal bridges to Matrix.
- Evaluate LND versus other Lightning implementations.
- Explore the integration of Paythering for meaningful transactions.
- Test and refine the Core Lightning implementation.
- Experiment with Matrix 2.0 proposals and ElementX.
- Try out nextcloud FORMS and ELEMENT plugins to manage data and user connections via web.
